# Script to retarget the pc-ble-driver-py dependencies to a different python install.
# The shared object in the library is linked against the system-installed python, which is not
# ideal since people commonly use brew-installed python instead (or anaconda).
#
# This script should be run within the python environment you want to use,
# and pc-ble-driver-py should already be pip-installed into the environment.
# This script also need the "Command Line Tools for Xcode" to use xcrun command
# You can find it here: https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=command%20line%20tools
#
# NOTE: This will need to be run any time pc-ble-driver-py is installed or updated, even virtual environments.
#       Easy test to see if it needs to be run: `from pc_ble_driver_py import config; config.__conn_ic_id__ = 'NRF52'; from pc_ble_driver_py import ble_driver;` will fail
